    %h2 Easy access to public data
    %p
      Public data is available but hard to find, parse, clean, and graph.  
      We make it easy to get public data just by filling in a text field.
    
    %h2 Visually compare data
    %p
      Relationships between raw datasets are hard to understand.  
      Our visualizations make it easy to compare different datasets 
      and understand them.

    %h2 Explore data
    %p
      Datasets are frozen in graphs and charts from the print era.  
      We make it easy to manipulate and combine datasets, so you can 
      explore and fly through data.
