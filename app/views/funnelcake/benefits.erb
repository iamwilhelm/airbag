    <h2>Easy access to public data</h2>
    <p>
      Public data is available but hard to find, parse, clean, and graph.  
      We make it easy to get public data just by filling in a text field.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Visually compare data</h2>
    <p>
      Relationships between raw datasets are hard to understand.  
      Our visualizations make it easy to compare different datasets 
      and understand them.
    </p>

    <h2>Explore data</h2>
    <p>
      Datasets are frozen in graphs and charts from the print era.  
      We make it easy to manipulate and combine datasets, so you can 
      explore and fly through data.
